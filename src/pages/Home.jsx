        As you can see I'm taking more of a personal approach/philosophy to building this website.
        I don't think it is worth it for this website to be a potential porfolio or anything more serious because it's my first website.
        By nature this first website can't be taken seriously; I'm just too new to web development.
        If any website should be bad, it should be this one and not a prospective porfolio. 
      </p>
      <p>
        So just explore what this beginning website has to offer!
